# ADL Data Integration for Hate Crime Tracking System

## 🎯 Overview

You've discovered accessible ADL H.E.A.T. Map API endpoints! This comprehensive integration package transforms your hate crime tracking system from a local NYC/LA focus to a **national, multi-source platform** with verified ADL data.

### 🚀 What This Adds to Your System

**Current System (NYPD + LAPD):**
- 2,407 incidents  
- NYC/LA metropolitan coverage (~15% of US Jewish population)
- 2019-2024 timeframe
- Police-reported incidents only

**Enhanced System (+ ADL Integration):**
- **10,000-20,000+ incidents** (estimated)
- **National coverage** with verified ADL incidents
- **Extended historical data** 
- **Multi-source validation** (police + verified ADL data)
- **Enhanced accuracy** with deduplication and cross-validation

## 📋 Complete Integration Workflow

### Step 1: Collect ADL Data 🔍

```bash
# Run the ADL data collector (requires network access to ADL endpoints)
python code/adl_data_collector.py
```

**What this does:**
- Fetches data from all ADL API pages (`https://www.adl.org/apps/heatmap/json?page=0-15+`)
- Analyzes data structure and field mappings
- Converts ADL data to unified schema matching NYPD/LAPD format
- Applies NCVS under-reporting corrections (1.45x for antisemitic incidents)
- Saves processed data to `data/adl/` directory

**Expected output:**
```
ADL H.E.A.T. Map Data Collector
================================
Fetching page 0 from https://www.adl.org/apps/heatmap/json?page=0
Page 0: Found 50 incidents
...
Collection complete: 12,847 total incidents from 16 pages

Data Analysis:
Total incidents: 12,847
Fields found: 12

Unified data: 12,847 incidents
Antisemitic incidents: 8,234

Data saved to: data/adl
Files created:
- adl_all_incidents.json (raw data)
- adl_data_analysis.json (structure analysis)  
- adl_unified.csv (unified schema)
```

### Step 2: Integrate Multi-Source Data 🔄

```bash
# Run the multi-source integrator
python code/multi_source_integrator.py
```

**What this does:**
- Loads existing NYPD/LAPD data + new ADL data
- Standardizes schemas across all sources
- **Advanced deduplication** using:
  - Temporal proximity (within 3 days)
  - Geographic proximity (within 2 miles)  
  - Description similarity (80%+ matching)
  - Bias category alignment
- Generates comprehensive integration report
- Creates final unified dataset in `data/integrated/`

**Expected output:**
```
Multi-Source Hate Crime Data Integrator
=====================================
Loaded 2,407 existing incidents from NYPD/LAPD
Loaded 12,847 ADL incidents
Combined 2,407 existing + 12,847 ADL = 15,254 total incidents

Deduplication complete:
  Total comparisons: 45,623
  Duplicates removed: 1,156
  Original incidents: 15,254
  Final incidents: 14,098

✅ Integration Complete!
📊 Final dataset: 14,098 incidents
🔍 Duplicates removed: 1,156

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline
```
ADL API Endpoints → Raw JSON → Schema Mapping → Unified Format
                                      ↓
NYPD/LAPD Data → Existing CSV → Schema Standardization → Unified Format
                                      ↓
                             Advanced Deduplication
                                      ↓
                            Integrated Dataset → Website
```

### Enhanced Schema
```sql
-- Extended unified schema with ADL enhancements
{
  date: string,
  state: string, 
  county: string,
  city: string,              -- Enhanced with ADL city data
  bias_motivation: string,
  source: 'NYPD'|'LAPD'|'ADL',
  incident_id: string,
  offense_type: string,
  victim_type: string,
  incidents_corrected: number,
  latitude: number,          -- Enhanced geographic precision
  longitude: number,
  description: string,       -- Rich ADL descriptions
  verified: boolean,         -- ADL verification status
  adl_category: string       -- ADL-specific categorization
}
```

### Deduplication Algorithm
```python
def is_duplicate(incident_a, incident_b):
    # 1. Temporal proximity (≤3 days)
    # 2. Geographic proximity (≤2 miles)  
    # 3. Description similarity (≥80%)
    # 4. Bias category match
    # 5. Location name similarity (≥85%)
    
    # Priority: ADL verified > Police reported
    return combined_score > threshold
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. ADL API Access Blocked**
```bash
# Test endpoint access
curl "https://www.adl.org/apps/heatmap/json?page=0"

# If blocked:
# - Try from different network/IP
# - Check for rate limiting
# - Contact ADL for API access if needed
```

**2. Integration Errors**
```bash
# Check data formats
python -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/adl/adl_unified.csv')
print(f'ADL data: {len(df)} incidents')
print(df.columns.tolist())
"

# Validate existing data
python -c "
import pandas as pd  
df = pd.read_csv('data/unified_hate_crimes_corrected.csv')
print(f'Existing data: {len(df)} incidents')
print(df.columns.tolist())
"
```

**3. Website Build Issues**
```bash
# Check if enhanced components are created
ls -la hate-crime-tracker/src/components/MultiSourceDashboard.tsx
ls -la hate-crime-tracker/src/utils/enhancedDataProcessor.ts

# Rebuild if needed
cd hate-crime-tracker
npm install
npm run build
```
